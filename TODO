* Add robust estimate for mean and std (Done);
* Flexible input for findHotspots (Done);
* Allow chromosome name to have more relaxed format (DONE);
* Multiple core support (quick and dirty fix of PP);
* Control short read redundancy internally;
* Support BAM input;
* Check number of replicates for different testing methods (DONE)
* Delete files using PERL API instead of 'rm' (done for main program)
